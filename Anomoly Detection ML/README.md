Credit Card Fraud Detection
This notebook uses predictive models to see how accuracte they are in determing fraud detection on a dataset with financial transactions. The dataset is heavily unbalanced with under 1% of data being fraudulent. We use f1 - score, precision/recall and confusion matrix for metrics (acccuracy score does not perform well on unbalanced datasets). All features in the dataset have been gone through PCA transformation and have been previously scaled.
